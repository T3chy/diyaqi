## Components

 Make sure you have all of your components; This includes

	- Raspberry pi Zero W*
	- BME280 Sensor with headers
	- 4 female to female jumper wires
	- a micro USB cable to power your pi
	- a micro SD card (at least 16GB in size)
	- Some way to interface with your microsd card (adapter, port, etc)
	- A computer running Windows, OS X (macOS), or linux**

**Note: you will need to wire up to the GPIO pins on the pi, so gettting a version with presoldered headers is recommended if you don't want to solder them yourself**

*no reason other versions shouldn't work if they have wifi (or are connected to ethernet), but untested

**if you use BSD you probably don't need to be reading this, but welcome! use dd or something lol


## Burning a Raspberry Pi OS Image

Let's get to work! There are two options to burn Raspberry Pi OS onto your pi.

#### Option 1: Raspberry Pi Imager (Recommended)

1. Download the latest version of Raspberry Pi Imager setup from https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/
2. Launch the setup and install it following the instructions shown on screen
3. Plug in your MicroSD card
4. Launch Raspberry Pi Imager
5. Click on `CHOOSE OS` -> `Raspberry Pi OS (other)` -> `Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)`
	- Note! This tutorial only requires the "Lite" verison, but feel free to download either the "with desktop" or "with desktop and recommended software" versions if you perfer, those will work too!
6. Click on `CHOOSE SD CARD` and select your MicroSD card from the list
7. Click `WRITE` and `YES`, and when it finishes click `CONTINUE` and close the program. Now you should have a bootable version of Raspberry Pi OS! Just a few more things to do before we put that card in the Pi

#### Option 2: Manual (Download Image + BalenaEtcher)

1. Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspian) image from https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/
	- Note! This tutorial only requires the "Lite" verison, but feel free to download either the "with desktop" or "with desktop and recommended software" versions if you perfer, those will work too!
2. Unzip the image. This can usually be done by right clicking the .zip file and clicking "extract here" or something similar
3. Download and install BalenaEtcher from https://www.balena.io/etcher/ for whatever operating system you are on
4. Plug in your MicroSD card
**Warning: the next steps will wipe all current data on your MicroSD Card**
5. Open BalenaEtcher (you may need to open it with admin privileges)
	- Click "Flash from file" and select the .img you extracted in step 3
	- Click "Select target" and then select your MicroSD card (make sure you aren't accidentally burning the image to a random flash drive that's plugged in!)
	- Click "Flash!" and wait for Etcher to do its thing (flashing and verifying your flash)
6. Once BalenaEtcher finishes, you should have a bootable version of Raspberry Pi OS! Just a few more things to do before we put that card in the Pi

## Headless Config

We will be setting up the pi "headless", which means we won't need to connect anything to it besides power to use it

This requires us to do some manual setup on the pi before we boot it up for the first time, but don't worry! Just follow the instructions carefully and you should be good to go!

Firstly, we need to enable ssh (secure shell) on the pi
	 (secure shell is a method by which a computer can remotley access another computer)

### Enabling secure shell access (ssh)
When you burned your Raspberry pi OS image, there should have been two 'partitions' created on your SD card. They will appear, on most operating systems, as two individual devices. We need to access the "boot" partition, which is the first partition and is also the smaller one. If you cannot find either, the imager may have automatically ejected the MicroSD card. In that case, just remove it and reinsert it.

**Look for files named "start.elf" and "cmdline.txt" to confirm you are in the boot partition**

Once you get into the boot partition, make a file called "ssh" with no extension and save it. An easy way of doing that on Windows is to make a text file but remove the `.txt` extension. Make sure that the system recognizes it as just a "file" and not a text document. The text inside it doesn't matter, so you can put anything you want in there (or nothing, it doesn't matter)

**SSH will now be enabled on first boot!**

### Automatically connecting to WiFi

**Note: skip this section if you are using ethernet (wired internet) for internet connectivity**

To automatically connect to wifi, we need to change a file called "wpa_supplicant.conf"; This file manages your Raspberry Pi automatically connecting to wifi on boot

Luckily, all we need to do is put our wpa supplicant in the boot folder and Rasberry Pi OS will locate it correctly for us! Isn't that nice? Let's do that real quick.

1. Create a file in the same boot folder we just put that 'ssh' file in, call it "wpa_supplicant.conf"
2. In that file put the following text, replacing <SSID> with your wifi network name, and <PASS> with that network's password (keeping the quotes around them)
	- If you live outside of the US, swap "US" for whatever ISO 2 letter code your country has

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
 ssid="<SSID>"
 psk="<PASS>"
}
```

**Your device is now ready for its first boot!**

## First boot!

The pi will take a little while to get itself going, go grab a coffee and give around 10 minutes to initalize.

Once you've given your pi 10 minutes to set up, we can access it from our computer!

## SSHing in

For MacOS or linux, you will aready have ssh installed. For windows, you MAY have ssh installed; try the steps below, and if you get an "ssh is not recognized as an internal or external command" kind of thing, follow the instructions for "ssh (PuTTY)" below

### MacOS, Linux, and (Modern) Windows

open your terminal and type in the following command and press enter

```shell
ssh pi@raspberrypi
```

You should be greeted with

```
pi@raspberrypi's password:
```

The default password is "raspberry" (when you type, nothing will show up. This is normal! Just type "raspberry" and press enter)

**Note: you may see something that looks like**
```
The authenticity of host 'raspberrypi (192.168.3.127)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:/ZBKVpFcCJh4Fl1gzgwIviCVNRWDBXFxL+WTL4TO+Fw.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
**before you are prompted for the password, just type "yes" and press enter to continue**

### Legacy Windows (PuTTY)

install [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), a simple ssh client for windows

1. open PuTTY

2. enter "raspberrypi" as the hostname, leave the port at 22 and press "Open"
3. enter "pi" to "Login As:"
4. Enter "raspberry" to "pi@raspberrypi's password:"

## Once you're in
Once you enter the password and press enter, a few lines looking similar to those below will appear (if you got the password right)

```

pi@raspberrypi:~ $
```

The version number and time will be different, but the important part is that you get that `pi@raspberrypi:~$`. That means you're in (you have a shell, or command line access on/to the pi)!

(*If you want, you can change the default password of "raspberry" by typing "passwd" in the shell prompt, pressing enter, and following the password change prompts*)

We now need to set up the sensor, and get it reporting. You're doing great!

We now need to set up the sensor, configure where we're sending the data, and configure the data-sending script to start every time we turn on our pi. Sounds like a lot, doesn't it? Luckily, most of the process is automated (thanks, scripting!).


All you need to do is run the following command while you're at the `pi@raspberrypi:~ $` prompt

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T3chy/diyaqi/main/boards/raspi/setup.sh && sudo chmod +x setup.sh && sudo ./setup.sh
```

**You will be prompted for your password after running this command; simple enter 'raspberry' (without the quotes) or the new password you previosly set and press enter.**

Follow the prompts in the script, and you should be good to go! Congratulations!!


## Troubleshooting


#### "I see \"The package cache file is corrupted\" !! Help!!
**Solution: run**

```
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

entering your password as needed, and then re run the install script with

```
sudo ./setup.sh
```
